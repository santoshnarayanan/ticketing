For Linux, I would recommend using ticketing.local. You will then update the ingress-srv.yml host to the following:

    - host: ticketing.local

And you will access in your browser:

https://ticketing.local/api/users/currentuser


Also, please make sure you are using the Minikube Ingress add-on and not applying the Docker Desktop Ingress

minikube addons enable ingress

The above step must be performed every time you delete your cluster and recreate.

Check to make sure the Ingress is running:

kubectl get services -n ingress-nginx

This should return something similar:

ingress-nginx-controller             NodePort    10.97.43.189    <none>        80:31070/TCP,443:30086/TCP   15m

ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP   10.104.166.22   <none>        443/TCP                      15m


Lastly, make sure you have run skaffold dev and verified the auth service is running with no errors. If you've made changes to the ingress you may want to run skaffold delete and then skaffold dev again.

If the 503 error persists, can you share your project code in a GitHub repo so I can try to replicate?
